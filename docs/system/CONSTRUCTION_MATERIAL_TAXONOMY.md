# Construction Material Taxonomy

## Purpose

Define the canonical material class vocabulary for the Construction domain. This taxonomy provides the bounded set of material references that assemblies, compositions, compatibility rules, and truth events may use.

The Material Taxonomy defines what materials exist in the canonical vocabulary. The Composition Model references materials as component properties. The Compatibility Model defines interactions between material classes.

## Taxonomy Governance

- This taxonomy defines the canonical material class vocabulary for Construction OS.
- New material classes may be admitted through governed determination only.
- Material classes must be grounded in material physics, not manufacturer branding.
- Runtime, VKBUS, and downstream consumers must not invent material classes.
- Manufacturer products map to canonical material classes as external references.

---

## Taxonomy Boundaries

This taxonomy is bounded. It covers construction materials commonly encountered in commercial building envelope and roofing applications. Expansion to other construction domains (structural, MEP, interior) requires governed admission.

The taxonomy is not a product database, manufacturer catalog, or specification library.

---

## Safety Note

- This document defines architecture documentation only
- No runtime code, schemas, or implementations are modified
- No existing registry entries are changed
- Governance doctrine: `Construction_Kernel/docs/governance/construction-material-doctrine.md`
