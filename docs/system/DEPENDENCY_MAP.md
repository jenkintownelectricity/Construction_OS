# DEPENDENCY_MAP — Construction_Runtime

## Stack Position

**Layer 6 — Domain Runtime**

## Upstream Dependencies

| Dependency | Layer | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Universal_Truth_Kernel | Layer 1 — Nucleus | Conceptual, transitive via Construction_Kernel. Ultimate ground of truth. |
| Construction_Kernel | Layer 4 — Domain Kernel | Defines construction truth this runtime executes. Direct upstream authority. |
| ValidKernel-Governance | Layer 2 — Governance | Governance rules constraining runtime behavior. |
| ValidKernel_Runtime | Layer 5 — Generic Runtime | Generic runtime patterns this domain runtime specializes. |

## Downstream Consumers

| Consumer | Layer | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Construction_Application_OS | Layer 7 — Application Shell | Apps consume runtime capabilities. |

## Relationship to Universal_Truth_Kernel

Executes applied construction truth ultimately grounded in the nucleus. Does not originate or redefine truth at any layer. Truth flows: Universal_Truth_Kernel → Construction_Kernel → Construction_Runtime (execution only).
